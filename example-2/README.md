# Example 2

In this example, we take an environmental data science project from Kaggle and show how Experiment Manager can help lighten the load on the developer. 
* Project originally from: https://www.kaggle.com/code/aashnaashahh1504/climate-change-forecasting-with-time-series

* The cell under the "Model Tuning" heading is re-written directly below using the Experiment Manager decorator (labelled "# EXPERIMENT MANAGER VERSION")

* To run the full project, make sure to download and add to your directory the corresponding input data from: https://www.kaggle.com/code/aashnaashahh1504/climate-change-forecasting-with-time-series/input
